    <h2>I'm Diana, nice to meet you.</h2>
    
    <p>During the daylight hours, I work in health economics research over at the Harvard School of Public Health. I have a strong interest in all things web, however, especially from
    the design perspective. <a href="http://siteinspire.com/showcase" target="_blank">Site Inspire</a> and <a href="http://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">dribbble</a> are two of my 	
    go-tos for ideas. I am taking this class to broaden my understanding of what is now capable on the web and to (hopefully) build some cool applications. 
    
    <p>The layout of this page is structured using <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a> - a 960 grid system. A great feature of the Skeleton framework is that 		
    it's responsive! I am also using a Google Web Font for the typeface (Open Sans) and am fairly convinced that Web Fonts are one of the best things since sliced bread.

		<h3>Project I.</h3>
		<p>The goal of this assignment was to get our workflows' nuts and bolts in place to prepare for the more 		
			complex coding projects to come. I've never had a true "workflow" to speak of, so this was a helpful exercise.</p>
        
        <p>My web hosting plan (purchased approximately four years ago and now apparently called a "Happy Hosting" plan) is through Dreamhost. Ah, gotta love inertia.</p> 			
		
		<p>To code up the HTML and CSS here, I used a combination of TextMate and Dreamweaver.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, here's a link to my little corner of the GitHub world: <a href="https://github.com/deastman313/dwa" target="_blank">deastman313</a> I'm using
        the GUI Source Tree in lieu of the command line.</p>
