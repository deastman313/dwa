	<p>Array positions are numbered starting from zero. If we want to know what the first number of a particular array is (in this case, 4), we would need to specify that we want position zero.<br> 
	<?php $array1 = array(4,8,15,16,23,42);?>
	<?php echo $array1[1];?>
	<?php $array2 = array(6, "fox", "dog", array("x", "y", "z"));?>
	<?php echo $array2[3][1];?>
